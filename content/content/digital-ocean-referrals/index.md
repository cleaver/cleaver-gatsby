## Update 2023-03-16:

I no longer use Digital Ocean for this site, so I no longer promote the referral code. Since this is a static site, I moved it to CloudFlare pages. When I push changes to my git repo, it builds the site and the new version automatically.

No complaints about Digital Ocean. I still have one server going that runs a few odds and ends. They're definitely worth considering for cloud services. You can still use the referral link below to save money if you're a new customer..

~~I use a VPS on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=0601bc016218)~~ to host this and other sites. I've been quite happy with the price and performance, so I thought I'd put up a referral link to see if I could cover a few costs.

When you sign up using my referral link, I receive a commission. There's no cost to you.

Here's the details:

##Timeline
 * Link added in an article: November 2013.
 * Sidebar link added: August 2014.
 * Removed the link from sidebar: March 2023.

##Performance to date
 * Clicks: 233
 * Referrals: 20
 * Credits Pending: $310
 * Credits Received: $175

tl;dr - Lots of people clicking, but not many buying.

##About the commissions
 * You don't pay any extra.
 * I only receive the pending credits if you spend $25
 * $25 is 5 months for the smallest server ($5/mo), although I recommend the $10 server as a minimum.
 * As far as I can tell, the credits can only be applied to hosting. I don't see a way to get cash.
 * The pending credits have been piling up, but I haven't actually received much of that.

##Summary
To date (March 2023), I have made $175 that was applied directly to hosting. This site no longer uses Digital Ocean, so I no longer promote the referral link.
