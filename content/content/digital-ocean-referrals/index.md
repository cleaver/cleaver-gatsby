I use a VPS on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=0601bc016218) to host this and other sites. I've been quite happy with the price and performance, so I thought I'd put up a referral link to see if I could cover a few costs.

When you sign up using my referral link, I receive a commission. There's no cost to you.

Here's the details:

##Timeline
 * Link added in an article: November 2013.
 * Sidebar link added: August 2014.

##Performance to date
 * Clicks: 202
 * Referrals: 20
 * Credits Pending: $310
 * Credits Received: $175

tl;dr - Lots of people clicking, but not many buying.

##About the commissions
 * You don't pay any extra.
 * I only receive the pending credits if you spend $25
 * $25 is 5 months for the smallest server ($5/mo), although I recommend the $10 server as a minimum.
 * As far as I can tell, the credits can only be applied to hosting. I don't see a way to get cash.
 * The pending credits have been piling up, but I haven't actually received much of that.

##Summary
To date (February 2021), I have made $175 that was applied directly to hosting. I'm currently on the $10/month VPS. Not exactly covering costs, but I'm happy with the result so far.
