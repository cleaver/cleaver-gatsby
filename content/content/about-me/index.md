I am the founder of Verge Interactive, a web development firm. I have developed web-based enterprise software for public and private sectors. My strengths include databases, data modelling and Javascript, Elixir, PHP, and Ruby. I'm a strong believer in open source software and I've been using Linux since kernel 1.2 back in 1995.

I've contributed to open source including Drupal, releasing a handful of contributed modules and adding patches for core and conbtrib. See the details on [drupal.org](http://drupal.org/user/141272) and on [Github](https://github.com/cleaver).
