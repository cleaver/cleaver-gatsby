I had the chance to sit down for dinner at Drupalcon this past May with [John P. Weiksnar](https://twitter.com/jpw1116) of the Western New York Drupal Users Group ([WNYDUG](https://groups.drupal.org/western-new-york)). After the conference, we had the time to do a quick interview, which was just published on Opensource.com.
