Web development is hard... but like the idiom says, "it's not rocket science".

But what if it was? Imagine this: Your team has been toiling for months and it's just a week from the launch of the Neptune probe. You're busy checking and rechecking the launch details when you get the call from the marketing manager: "Sorry to do this to you guys, but there's a few last minute changes. No big deal, I'm sure you can handle it [before you go home tonight](https://clientsfromhell.net/client-i-need-this-by-thursday-me-shouldnt-be/)."

*"No big deal..."* That's never a good sign. You wonder what it could be this time?

"Yeah, so... we signed a deal with Disney and we need to go to Pluto instead. Yeah, it's gonna be sweet! Besides, I heard that Pluto is closer than Neptune now."

*Facepalm.* You try to explain that even though Pluto *was* closer, [since 1999 it has been getting farther.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto#Orbit_and_rotation) Not that it would matter, Pluto is in a completely separate part of the solar system. The [gravity assist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist) we planned on wouldn't get us that far on limited fuel.

"Don't worry... this deal is HUGE! I'll get you all the fuel you want!"

*Sigh.* You're not getting through. Trying a different approach, you ask what we would do once we get there. The mission was designed to study the atmosphere of Neptune.

"Atmosphere... whenever I ask for something simple, you geeks start throwing around these technical terms! It's cleared legal, so there should be no problem. No more technical mumbo jumbo... I want results!"

Dumbfounded, you just stare at the manager.

"What? We can't change this now... We've already scheduled a press conference."

You switch off your computer.

"Hey... don't worry, I'll order a pizza. I can expense it!"

*Note: I've never experienced this sort of horror story first hand, but I've heard a few chilling tales and I'm an avid reader of [Clients from Hell](http://clientsfromhell.net). I am sort of sick of pizza though.*
